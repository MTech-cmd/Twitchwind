# About
Twitchwind is a clone of the Twitch front page built entirely with Tailwind CSS.\
I developed this during my study at the Bit Academy

# License
For this project like many of mine I made use of the <a href="LICENSE">GNU Affero General Public License v3.0</a>

# The Stack
For this project I mainly used Tailwind CSS, a tiny bit of CSS3 and ofcourse HTML5. I also used NPM and Prettier to install Tailwind locally and lastly I used GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages for the CI/CD.\
